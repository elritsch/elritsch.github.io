About Elmar Ritsch
==================

I'm a passionate computational physicist with a strong background in developing high performance C++ applications for Monte Carlo simulations of CERN's big data experiments. I like spending my free time developing well-tested algorithmic trading applications in Python and combining them with machine learning techniques. I love the idea of open-source software and I have contributed to a number of public projects. You might also find me doing penetration tests of public websites, flying single engine airplanes with my friends or spending time outdoors in the alps.
